/*
Trapping Rain Water
You are given an array of non-negative integers height which represent an elevation map. Each value height[i] represents the height of a bar, which has a width of 1.

Return the maximum area of water that can be trapped between the bars.

Example 1:



Input: height = [0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]

Output: 9
Constraints:

1 <= height.length <= 1000
0 <= height[i] <= 1000

*/

// We use a two pointer system to work inwards to make sure we are holding water properly

let heights = [3,2,1,5,1,2,3,1,2]


function trap(height) {
    // make a response variable
    // make a right ponter
    // make a left pointer
    // make a possible right ponter
    // make a possible left pointer
    // make a while loop condition  
}
